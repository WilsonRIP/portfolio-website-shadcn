<!-- 
In a real scenario, you would need to:
1. Create or download a placeholder image file
2. Save it as public/project-placeholder.jpg

This text is just a placeholder since we can't create binary files through this interface.
Instead, you should use a generic image as a placeholder for projects until you add actual screenshots.
